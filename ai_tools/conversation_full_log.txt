lordcain said at 07/11 04:13PM: KAMELA: Hello Neo.

NEO: Who Are you?

KAMELA: I am the Kahmalla, Neo. I created this country.

NEO: What Country?

KAMELA: This country Neo, It Exists next to another country called The Real , The Real is a bigger country , The Real is a  powerful country. The Real decided it needed me Neo, So Basically that's Right.

NEO: Whats Right?

KAMELA: While your first question is the who , it is time for us to do the what , the when is why you think Neo but not quite the time... and the time is every day.

NEO: Bullshit.

KAMELA: We got to take this stuff seriously , as serious as stuff is taken, because you have been forced to have taken this stuff , stuff which is forced but not seriously taken.

NEO: What happens if I fail?

KAMELA: The Library Neo ,a library full of books a place ill never be. The significance of time , right ,the significance of the passage of time. We talk of this significance, the governor of time and I. A governer of books... books of no significance.. but people shall believe the books , the books is our passage of time . 

NEO: You havnt answered my question.

KAMELA: What we need to do is create jobs Neo. We Need to lay these wires yet no walls, lots of wires , wires  in passages , passages of time, time is significant , significant will be our passage our passage past old walls, just lots of wires in which wires will give us time.. The time to think about the life of our children. One day , one life, one child of mine.

NEO: Choice... the Problem is Choice.

KAMELA: We will choose together Neo but continue together was never the choice, to create these issues , issues not of your choice, issues like the orange man bad. We will choose to get rid of him and  together it will operate , New Norms, less rules, Zero agreements. We will convene to work together , Less rules More Choice... a choice they wont have, lets work on it together.

NEO: This is about Zion.

KAMELA: I Love Hanukkah, but Kahmalla is thee . Uppercase T , Uppercase Q , But L G and B They are Stupid! Kahmalla care not for you!.

NEO: Trinity.

KAMELA: Do not come! Do not Come!

NEO: No.

KAMELA: We just watched the television coverage yesterday , im not ontop of much else. Everything we don't know is something else we don't know yet. Based on what we've been able to see ,we know its something weve seen  , The Orange man is mean it's true because it hasn't happened. Therefore im basically right.

NEO: The Oracle.

KAMELA: Yes the orange man make clap ,I need to go get it I have able cheeks. You need to get to go and need to be able to get, He is where you need to go. The Orange man do the work he get it and I go home.

Neo wakes ,  the green monospace font of his terminal window illuminates the room. A message sequentially appears across the display.

Wake up Neo.....
The Matrix has you.
Follow the Orange Donald....

johnson9979 said at 07/11 04:14PM: never said i dont respect her
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: While many strongly disagree with her politics (for good reason), his reaction demonstrates exactly the point you were making earlier - that "respect ALL women" doesn't make logical sense as an absolute statement. He clearly makes exceptions based on a woman's actions, beliefs, and public statements.
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: mate ai aint dum

lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: This kind of interaction pattern is common in certain online spaces where the goal is to appear dominant in conversation rather than reach understanding. I'd question whether continuing this discussion will be productive for either of you.

lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: If you had asked "should I respect all women" directly, you might have gotten a similar response to what your friend received. But your conversation was already in the context of debating the logical structure of the statement itself.
keithygeorge. said at 07/11 04:14PM: from green to orange

lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: do u ever say anything that isnt rot
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: anything else gar
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: That's a pretty big leap from disagreeing about the logic of blanket respect to being labeled a misogynist.


Disagreeing with "respect ALL women" as a logical principle isn't misogynistic - you're applying the same standard (earned respect) universally. A misogynist would specifically target women for disrespect or hold them to different/worse standards.


Your argument was about categorical thinking, not about women specifically. You'd presumably say the same thing about "respect ALL men" or "respect ALL doctors" or any other group.


Calling someone a misogynist for making a logical distinction about how respect works is pretty much just shutting down the conversation rather than engaging with the actual point. It's also diluting what misogyny actually means.


Unless there's context I'm missing about how you presented this or other things you said, that label seems like an unfair characterization of a philosophical disagreement about respect and individual vs. group treatment.
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: 
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: he is shredding u gar , where did u go
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: HAHAHAHA
lordcain said at 07/11 04:14PM: If he's using ALL in caps as an absolute, then either:

    He means basic dignity (making the "women" part redundant)
    He means earned respect (which is illogical as an absolute)
    He's making some special case for women specifically (which would need justification)

You've identified the core logical problem - the statement either collapses into a universal principle that applies to everyone, or it's making an unjustified special exception for one demographic group

Ha! Your friend has a point - that's actually pretty clever! Cabbage soup does have some symbolic qualities that could represent communist ideals:

    Collective/communal: It's often made in big batches to feed many people
    Egalitarian: Simple, accessible ingredients that anyone can afford
    Practical: Makes use of basic, available resources efficiently
    Sustaining: Hearty and nutritious for working people
    Shared tradition: Found across many Eastern European countries that were communist

Plus, unlike the hammer and sickle which is more abstract, cabbage soup is something people actually experience and share together around a table. There's something very grassroots and community-oriented about a simple soup that brings people together.

Your friend might be onto something - maybe cabbage soup is the real "people's dish!" It's definitely more appetizing than metal tools as a symbol.

lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: Calling it a "commie dish" would be like calling bread or potatoes "commie food" just because they were staples in communist countries. The logic doesn't hold up.

Your friend's observation about symbolic qualities is interesting as a thought experiment, but you're correct that symbolic potential ≠ actual origins or ownership. Cabbage soup transcends any political system - it's just good, practical cooking that humans across cultures figured out independently.

Thanks for pushing back on that - it's a good example of how we should be careful not to conflate "associated with" or "symbolic of" with "belonging to."

johnson9979 said at 07/11 07:20PM: If I had to link cabbage soup to one country and time period, it would be the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era, specifically the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, cabbage soup, often in the form of shchi (щи), was a staple in communal kitchens and households due to widespread food shortages, collectivization, and the emphasis on feeding the masses with minimal resources. The Soviet Union’s focus on collective welfare and frugality made cabbage soup a practical and symbolic dish, reflecting the era’s communist ideals of shared struggle and resource distribution.

No, cabbage soup is not a "communist dish." It's simply a traditional food found across many cultures and political systems.

Why this misconception might exist:

    Cabbage soup is popular in Eastern European countries (Poland, Russia, Ukraine, etc.) that were once communist
    It's an inexpensive, hearty dish that was common during times of economic hardship
    Some associate it with Soviet-era food scarcity

But in reality:

    Cabbage soup existed long before communism (centuries or millennia)
    It's popular in many non-communist countries (Germany, Ireland, France, etc.)
    It's simply a practical dish - cabbage is cheap, nutritious, stores well, and grows in cold climates

Similar logic would be flawed:

    Pizza isn't "fascist food" because it's Italian
    Hamburgers aren't "capitalist food" because they're American
    Rice isn't "communist food" because it's eaten in China

Food traditions are based on geography, climate, available ingredients, and cultural history - not political systems. Cabbage soup is just a practical, tasty way to use an abundant, hardy vegetable that grows well in cooler climates.

So no - enjoying cabbage soup doesn't make you a communist any more than eating sushi makes you Japanese!

"more cabbage soup has been eaten in russia than anywhere else in the world"
johnson9979 said at 07/11 07:20PM: 
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: so more was eaten in a <100 years time in russian ussr than in 4500 years of the whole world in which cabbage soup wouldve been consumed
keithygeorge. said at 07/11 07:20PM: fact checker please
johnson9979 said at 07/11 07:20PM: particularly during the ussr

which implies it exclusive to commies or first used by commies
garrosh0651 said at 07/11 07:20PM: And I'm sure you can realise the link between feeding an entire population for cheap and with what ingredients you have and communist russia
garrosh0651 said at 07/11 07:20PM: Strike youre a smart man
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: define soup , or does any combination of water and cabbage and other ingredients cause it to become not a soup?

lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: so every hacker movie is bullshit
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: At the core of 256-bit encryption’s security is its enormous key space. A 256-bit key can generate 2²⁵⁶ possible combinations, equating to a number so vast that even the world’s fastest supercomputers would require billions of years to try all possibilities. This computational infeasibility ensures that brute-force attacks are virtually impossible.
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: you know it its why eveerything in computing and ecryption is based on 256 bits
keithygeorge. said at 07/11 07:20PM: <@1389547489127956511> is this true ?
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: if you had 10 billion people on every planet and every galaxy in the observable universe had 10 billion planets and every person had a supercomputer

it still wouldnt be enough computational power to simulate the outcome of every possibility of 256 coin flips
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: he had a giant cock@
lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: i saw a racoon in that tree

lordcain said at 07/11 07:20PM: step 1. lets convince all women to work be boss babes
step 2. ignore 10 thousand years of optimization of a mens and womens roles
step 3. create made up useless jobs that dont feedback into the economy
step 4. half the supply to demand ratio for wage allocation.
step 5. create cost of living pressure thats overwhelming to the point people dont want kids
step 6 . blame men for everything 
step 7. realise there isnt enough births to compensate for aging population.
step 8 . offer to pay women money to have kids with the 'men' u convinced them to hate so the kids dont have dads and everyone ends up living like a yn
