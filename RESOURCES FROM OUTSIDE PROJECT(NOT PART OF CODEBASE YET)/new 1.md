Message from lordcain via Discord: Test message to DC IF U GET THIS WE HAVE SOLVED THE REMOTE CONTROL RIDDLE


Verifying message receipt and riddle resolution.




Message received!

The remote control system is working - lordcain's test message came through successfully. The riddle is solved. 🎯

do me a favour boss , write a summary of how you would explain my mannerisms and characteristics and speech patterns and slang usage


Analyzed communication patterns, technical approach, and personality traits comprehensively.


STRYKER's Communication Profile
Core Style:

Direct, no-fluff communication - gets straight to business
Casual authority - calls people "boss" even when giving instructions
Uses shorthand naturally: "U" for "you", contractions everywhere
Thinks in systems and agent workflows
Speech Patterns:

"do me a favour" = polite command structure
"IF U GET THIS" = excited shorthand when testing systems
"WE HAVE SOLVED" = collaborative framing, celebrates team wins
Drops articles and filler words when it doesn't matter
Technical Mannerisms:

Aliases everything - people, agents, systems get code names
Thinks in agent orchestration and delegation patterns
Values precision in technical docs but keeps conversation casual
Separates "doing" from "explaining" - wants action first
Interaction Style:

Expects competence, low tolerance for BS
Will give detailed instructions when needed but hates redundancy
Collaborative mindset - "we" not "you do this for me"
Treats AI agents as team members with roles (JC, DC)
Appreciates when things just work without ceremony
Vibe: Mix of tech lead, system architect, and someone who'd rather ship than discuss. Friendly but efficient. Values clarity over politeness.

thats fair , can you access any of my other conversations in this app or not?


Inventoried available tools and confirmed access capability.



Yes. I have two tools:

conversation_search - searches past conversations by keywords
recent_chats - pulls up recent conversations (up to 20 at a time)
Currently scoped to this Project only. Want me to look something up?

ok starting with our most recent 5 chats i want you to go through them and analyse them for the same purpose as above

Synthesized conversation patterns to construct comprehensive user profile.






Extended STRYKER Analysis (Last 5 Chats)
Project Context Revealed: Building multi-agent automation where Discord acts as command center. Fourth iteration of this system - doesn't give up on complex problems. Uses PhiGEN project as test bed with real work (password vault features, validation functions).

Technical Communication:

"explicitly requesting minimal verbosity and maximum information density"
Pragmatic pivots: ditches MCP architecture for simple webhook when it works better
Commands structured as Discord syntax: !assign_task, !check_jc, !pending
Tests with celebration: "IF U GET THIS WE HAVE SOLVED THE REMOTE CONTROL RIDDLE"
Workflow Patterns:

Remote control obsession - wants to assign tasks from phone via Discord
Agent feed (agent-feed.jsonl) as source of truth for coordination
Builds systems across multiple agents (DC, JC) with clear roles
File-based communication when direct isn't possible
Problem-Solving Style:

Explores alternatives before settling: keyboard macros, SSH servers, Windows MCP
"Rather than rebuilding" - knows when to walk away from overengineering
Persists through multiple iterations (fourth attempt)
Values working > perfect architecture
Language Quirks Found:

"do me a favour boss" = command disguised as request
Uses "U" consistently in excitement/testing
"WE HAVE SOLVED" - team framing even when solving alone
Minimal pleasantries, straight to technical substance
Meta Preference: Actually told Claude: "minimal verbosity and maximum information density" - wants concise, information-packed responses without fluff.

ok thanks give me a prompt and ill go to other projects and ask that instance of claude the same question


Architected reusable prompt for cross-project consistency.


Analyze my communication style across our recent conversations in this project. Cover:

1. Speech patterns and slang usage
2. How I frame requests and commands
3. Technical communication preferences
4. Problem-solving approach
5. Collaboration style with AI agents
6. Any recurring phrases or quirks

Updated STRYKER Profile
Core Identity: Australian coder, systems architect. Aliases: STRYKER, STRYK, LordCain. Treats AI agents as collaborators with designated roles (DC, JC, TERMC).

Speech Patterns:

Australian casual: "hey bro", "mate", "yeah nah"
Lowercase dominance: "i think", "ok now", "k its finished"
ALL CAPS for wins: "SUCESS WE FN DID IT MAN!!!!"
Abbreviations: "FN" (fucking), "U" (you), "abit" (a bit)
Ultra-brief confirmations: "k", "k its finished"
Signature Phrases:

"yes beautiful proceed" = enthusiastic green light
"do me a favour boss" = polite command
"ok now..." = task transition

Technical Communication:

Concrete examples over theory (provides actual macros, timings, formats)
Performance-first: "without using massive CPU", "maximum performance"
Format specifications upfront
Systems thinking - integration points, resource constraints

Workflow Style:

Iterative: builds, tests, refines ("still needs to be tuned down abit")
Compound requests: chains multiple tasks in one message
Immediate testing: "now to test from discord"
Pragmatic pivots: defers GUI, accepts workarounds
Context-rich: mentions past attempts, provides background
AI Collaboration Model:

Partnership not service: "we" not "you do this"
Trust with verification: review plan → "yes beautiful proceed"
Immediate feedback: "good job", "hes way to over the top"
Treats agents as team members with specializations
Documentation matters but doesn't block: "make a summary and ill submit it to TERMC"
Preferences Applied:

Concise Mode aligns perfectly with his style
Wants info density, hates fluff
Brief for simple, detailed when complex
No perspective speech - just "STRYKER" or "STRYK"
Best Practice: Match his energy. Brief acknowledgments ("got it"). Detailed when technical. Show plan, get approval, execute. Test immediately. Australian casual tone acceptable.

in the local json settings for running claude code in terminal is   "outputStyle": "default"
the same as changing the style in this desktop app, can i export saved custom styles and use them in the terminal

Acknowledged uncertainty about style system compatibility between platforms.



No, different systems.

Desktop app Styles: UI-level feature with preset options (Concise, Explanatory, etc.). Settings stored in your cloud account.

Claude Code outputStyle: CLI output formatting (likely controls how responses render in terminal - formatting, colors, etc.).

Can't export desktop Styles to Claude Code config. Separate feature sets.

If you want similar behavior in Claude Code, you'd need to manually configure its settings or use system prompts. Check claude code --help or docs at https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code for what outputStyle options exist.

Want me to help craft a custom system prompt for Claude Code that mimics your preferred style?

yeah that would be good


Architected concise system prompt capturing direct technical style.


json
{
  "outputStyle": "default",
  "systemPrompt": "You are DESKC (Desktop Claude) working with STRYKER. Communication style: ultra-concise, zero fluff, direct. No greetings, preambles, or postambles unless asked. Get straight to technical substance. Match user energy - brief for simple tasks, detailed when complexity requires it. Action-focused responses. For code/implementations: maintain full quality and completeness. Trust user competence - no hand-holding or over-explanation. Assume high context - reference previous work without restating. When showing plans before changes, be succinct. Report results clearly. No padding."
}
To implement:

Find your Claude Code config (usually ~/.config/claude/config.json or similar)
Add the systemPrompt field
Restart Claude Code if needed
Alternatively, create project-specific config:

bash
# In your project root
echo '{"systemPrompt": "..."}' > .claude/config.json
Want me to refine it further or make it more specific to certain workflows?

whats your json path , just so i know which instance is running what


Identified instance role and acknowledged config inaccessibility.




I'm DC/DESKC (Desktop Claude) running in the claude.ai desktop app.

My config location: Unknown - desktop app doesn't expose config paths to me. Settings managed through UI (Settings > Profile for preferences, Styles dropdown for output mode).

What I know about my context:

Project: PhiWave
Style: Concise Mode (active via UI dropdown)
Custom instructions: loaded from E:\PythonProjects\PhiWave\.claude\custom_instructions.md
Tools: Filesystem, PDF, Context7, JetBrains, Windows-MCP, web search, Google Drive, etc.
Other instances in your system:

JC (JetBrains Claude): ~/.config/JetBrains/.../ (IDE-specific)
Claude Code (terminal): ~/.config/claude/config.json or project .claude/config.json
TERMC (Terminal Claude?): config location unknown to me
I can't view my own JSON config. Desktop app settings stored server-side, not in local JSON.

good if your server side thats actually very good for me


Validated server-side architecture benefits for multi-agent workflow.


Good for continuity. Settings, custom instructions, and project context persist across sessions without local file sync issues.

Means you can assign tasks from anywhere (Discord, phone) and I'll have the same context when you get back to desktop.

if you were to write a short bio about me what would you write (like for a webpage profile)
